\title{More efficient forward Sinkhorn scaling algorithm which check the convergence}
\usage{
efficient_sinkhorn(
  V,
  max_iter = 20L,
  iter_start_check = 5L,
  check_every_iter = 3L,
  epsilon = 1.490116e-08
)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{matrix to scale.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum iterations of the Sinkhorn scaling. Default is 20 iterations.}

\item{iter_start_check}{From which iteration should the function checks the convergence. By default, check started from iteration 5.}

\item{check_every_iter}{How offeten should we check the convergence. The default is check every 3 iterations.}

\item{epsilon}{The tolerance for convergece. Default value is 1.490116e-08, which is similar to R's built in `all.equal` function.}
}
\value{
named list of V_row, V_col, D_row, D_col, iterations.
