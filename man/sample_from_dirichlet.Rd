\title{Sample n points, Dirichlet-distributed on a k-dimensional standard simplex
with means from 0 to 1, proportional to the numbers from the `alpha` argument.
Number of cell types is derived from `alpha`'s length. The `spread` argument
defines the deviation of generated values from one and zero.}
\usage{
sample_from_dirichlet(n, k, alpha = NULL, spread = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of points}

\item{k}{dimensionality of generatred data}

\item{alpha}{proportional coefficient}

\item{spread}{deviation of generated values from one and zero.}
