\item{coef_pos_D_h}{EXPERIMENTAL: penalty for D_h value (how far X^TxDh if from A(R))). should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{coef_pos_D_w}{EXPERIMENTAL: penalty for D_w value (how far OmegaxDw if from B(S))). should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{limit_X}{EXPERIMENTAL: if you want to restrict X from changing to much. should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{limit_Omega}{EXPERIMENTAL: if you want to restrict Omega from changing to much. should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{cosine_thresh}{EXPERIMENTAL: if you want to restrict derivative from changing to much. should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{alternative_method}{should we use alternative approach to optimization or not.  (without matrix D and with strict invertibility constraint)}
