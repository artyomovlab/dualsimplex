\arguments{
\item{coef_der_X}{learning rate for X space}

\item{coef_der_Omega}{learning rate for Omega space}

\item{coef_hinge_H}{positiviy penalty for X space (lambda)}

\item{coef_hinge_W}{positiviy penalty for Omega space (beta)}

\item{coef_pos_D_h}{EXPERIMENTAL: penalty for D_h value (how far X^TxDh if from A(R))). should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{coef_pos_D_w}{EXPERIMENTAL: penalty for D_w value (how far OmegaxDw if from B(S))). should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{limit_X}{EXPERIMENTAL: if you want to restrict X from changing to much. should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{limit_Omega}{EXPERIMENTAL: if you want to restrict Omega from changing to much. should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{cosine_thresh}{EXPERIMENTAL: if you want to restrict derivative from changing to much. should be 0 since not tested.}

\item{x_center}{X rays around which to perform search in theta search.}

\item{omega_center}{Omega rays around which to perform search in theta search.}

\item{center_threshold}{constraint for the  step.}

\item{solution_balancing_threshold}{EXPERIMENTAL: only for positivity so far. If optimization going to far from the points in one space, some value of this distance will be transferred to the second space/}

\item{method}{method of optimization to use can be  basic/positivity.}
