\title{Function to gess order of rows for the predicted markers to have the highest sum correlation with true matrix.
If the number of true matrix rows is smaller, will mark some rows as "extra rows" to keep predicted rows.
Implemented using lp.assign method.
Ensure your columns are in the matching order!}
\usage{
guess_order(predicted_matrix, true_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{predicted_matrix}{predicted matrix}

\item{true_matrix}{true matrix}
}
\value{
list containing row numbers for selected predicted cell type for given true cell type.
