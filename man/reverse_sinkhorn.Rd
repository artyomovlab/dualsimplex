\title{reverse Sinkhorn transform scaled matrix}
\usage{
reverse_sinkhorn(H_row, W_col, scaling)
}
\arguments{
\item{H_row}{solution matrix H_ss produced by optimization algorithm (X*R)}

\item{W_col}{solution matrix W_gs produced by optimization algorithm (t(S)*Omega)}

\item{scaling}{dso$scaling object containing normalization matrices}
}
\value{
unscaled object
}
\description{
Calculate all normalizing matrices and restore "unscaled" W and H
columns of D_ws_col and D_hs_row will contain history of D_w and D_h matrices
W_column, H_column will contain "unscaled" W and H
}
