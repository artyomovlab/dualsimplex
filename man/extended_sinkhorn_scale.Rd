\title{Extended sinkhorn scaling to track all the matrices produced.
This is extremely usefull if you want to track back the results and find "true" coordinates of W and H in sinkhorned space.}
\usage{
extended_sinkhorn_scale(V, W, H, n_iter)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{input matrix V  (V = WH)}

\item{W}{input matrix W}

\item{H}{input matrix H}

\item{n_iter}{exact number of iterations performed}
